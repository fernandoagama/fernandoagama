### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A multi-skilled project manager with a good all-round ability to juggle multiple projects and meet deadlines whilst simultaneously comprehending complex and interdependent business processes. Very capable with an ability to identify and then deal with a client's needs by translating them into technical solutions. Experienced in providing motivation, guidance, and up-to-date consultancy service to both colleagues and clients. With deep knowledge of PMI-ACP (PMBOK 6), PMP, SCRUM MASTER, financial analysis, ERPs, and CRMs. I have outstanding communication skills with the ability to explain detailed, technical program-specific information. Also, I have been a lecturer in MBA for over 12 years. Now looking for a new and challenging architect position, one that will utilise my existing skills and experience while furthering my development.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112650856/212498587-cc5d0003-c9b5-4375-bc7b-3ff959526f52.png)

With a completed Master's degree in Business Administration â€“ Focus in Finance, I decided to transition into a career in  the tech space. As a result, I enrolled in a Software Engineering course at HyperionDev.  During my course I learnt Python, Java, and SQL. I created over 30 programs in these languages. I also performed tasks involving problem solving and complex mathematics such as k-means algorithms. I completed my course with a 99% average.  My work experience and education required working under tight deadlines and thinking  creatively. I believe my experience has demonstrated my skills in data collection, management and processing, as well as in communication.

I am keen to learn more about software development and gain new skills and abilities while  building upon the skills and abilities which I possess.
